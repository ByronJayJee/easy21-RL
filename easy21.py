# Easy21 - Reinforcement Learning Assignment
# 
# The goal of this assignment is to apply reinforcement learning methods to a
# simple card game that we call Easy21. This exercise is similar to the Blackjack
# example in Sutton and Barto 5.3 – please note, however, that the rules of the
# card game are different and non-standard.
# --- The game is played with an infinite deck of cards (i.e. cards are sampled
#     with replacement)
#
# --- Each draw from the deck results in a value between 1 and 10 (uniformly
#     distributed) with a colour of red (probability 1/3) or black (probability
#     2/3).
#
# --- There are no aces or picture (face) cards in this game
#
# --- At the start of the game both the player and the dealer draw one black
#     card (fully observed)
#
# --- Each turn the player may either stick or hit
#
# --- If the player hits then she draws another card from the deck
#
# --- If the player sticks she receives no further cards
#
# --- The values of the player’s cards are added (black cards) or subtracted (red
#     cards)
#
# --- If the player’s sum exceeds 21, or becomes less than 1, then she “goes
#     bust” and loses the game (reward -1)
#
# --- If the player sticks then the dealer starts taking turns. The dealer always
#     sticks on any sum of 17 or greater, and hits otherwise. If the dealer goes
#     bust, then the player wins; otherwise, the outcome – win (reward +1),
#     lose (reward -1), or draw (reward 0) – is the player with the largest sum.
